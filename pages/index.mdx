HacKnight is a 14-hour hackathon where students use technology to create solutions to problems that their local communities face. A hackathon is a place where students come together and use technology to solve problems and win prizes! _*HacKnight has no affiliation with any school. This event is an independently organized and run event.*_

HacKnight is a place where students with almost no experience in technology can come to learn and create technological solutions to real world problems. Youâ€™ll walk away with new technical, design and business skills, a project to brag about, and maybe even a prize!
