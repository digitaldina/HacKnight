# HackNight's Website
On November 2019, students are coming together for a fun filled 14-hours in Milton, Ontario, Canada in order to help their communities using technology at HackNight. This is the registration and information site for the event and was created using [Hack Penn's beautiful recap website](https://hackpenn.com/) as a template.
